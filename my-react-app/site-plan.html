			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				My purpose for this site is to learn how to create an app using the 
				React library. The other purpose for this site is to learn better 
				programming skills that will help me later on as I search for jobs
				after I graduate from BYU-Idaho.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				My audience for this project is young adults who are into video games.
				People love video games today, and they love to share their epic battles,
				massive losses, crippling defeats, and glorious victories.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				The page will use React to display card information. 
				The Sign in page will use a form that must be filled out 
				in order to move into the "app". 
			</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/7f7a9a-f72d40-d3d3d3-ffd86a"
				target="_blank"

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#7F7A9A]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#d3d3d3]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#f72d40]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#ffd86a]</td>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: "Roboto Flex", sans-serif
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Roboto
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Today I was playing some Legend of Zelda when I unlocked the gauntlets 
				that let you lift heavy objects. It was super funny when I chucked a giant 
				granite pillar across the map.
